<h3>TLDR: Love is you, always..</h3>
<!--break-->

* <p>Always waiting me going home after work</p>
* <p>Be my alarm..</p>
* <p>Always there if I have bad day</p>
* <p>Buying you food if I have money (even she hasn't too)</p>
* <p>Call me in work hour (and chat: notice me!!)</p>

etc..

Do you know your 'annoying' behaviour makes me happy?

You made my day better...

You, I want you.
