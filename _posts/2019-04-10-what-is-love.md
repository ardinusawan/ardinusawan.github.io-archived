TLDR: Love is you, always..
<!--break-->

* Always waiting me going home after work
* Be my alarm..
* Always there if I have bad day
* Buying you food if I have money (even she hasn't too)
* Call me in work hour (and chat: notice me!!)

etc..

Do you know your 'annoying' behaviour makes me happy?

You made my day better...

You, I want you.
