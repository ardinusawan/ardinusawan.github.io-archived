<h3>TDD? What is that?</h3>
TDD is you implementing unit testing with test driven development approach.

<h3>What is unit testing?</h3>
In computer programming, <!--break--> unit testing is a software testing  method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.

<h3>What are the differences between TDD with unit test?</h3>
* <p>You can have unit test without using TDD.</p>
* <p>You can’t do TDD without unit test.</p>
* <p>With TDD, you should have unit test for all your code.</p>

Hmm, can you explain more about TDD?
Test Driven Development can be described in terms of three simple rules(law):

* First Law You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.

* Second Law You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.

* Third Law You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

Get it? 😝

When following a TDD approach, typically you go through a cycle of Red-Green-Refactor.

But the question is: does TDD spark joy? 😶

For me, absolutely yes!

The goals of TDD are:
* <p>Clean code that works</p>
* <p>Simplicity: maximize the work not done</p>
* <p>KISS: KeepIt Simple Stupid</p>

Does that spark joy for you? Give TDD a try folks! 

Intellij made a good tutorial for this in Java. If it doesn’t spark joy for you, just keep doing it because “results will not betray effort” 😙

Kidding! Read this and this.

May god be with you(TDD is hard, trust me)
