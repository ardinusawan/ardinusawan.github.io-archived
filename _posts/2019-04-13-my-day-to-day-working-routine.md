<h3>10-7 That was my magic number</h3>

Working in <i>startup</i> never be a wrong decision.

We have freedom to choose our work day, <!--break-->but we must work 8 hours + 1 hour break time.

Usually people come at 10 AM, and me too. If I come before that hours, the temperature is very hot because our office use integrated AC with the rest of building (Pasaraya Blok M mall) and the mall open at 10 AM :smile:

From 10 AM to 12 AM, I pick task in [Jira][1] or continue my unfinished yesterday task.

From 12 AM to 1 PM, had lunch in pantry or Blok M Square. If I go to Blok M Square or any other places with my team, maybe at 1.30 PM I just sat down in my desk :grimacing:

If any discount in Kopi Kenangan, I will go there. If not, I just bought from coffee machine in the office (pay with gopay got cashback 40% lol)

From 1 PM to 5 PM is my golden hours. 80% of my work done in this hours (If no meeting).

Previously I have pair and we love to [pair programming][2]. But after I return from bootcamp my pair was transferred to another team. So I decided to move beside my tech lead to have a little pair with him XD

Sometimes bug hit us, and I must focus on that. That make me to buy more coffee and in the night I just cannot sleep.

From 5 PM to 7 PM it depend on the task. If I already create [merge request][3] usually I comeback to see my work and thinking if any I can do better. If it not, I continue to work.

Right now, there so many discount on e-wallet services. After work hours, I and several of my colleague find the nearest restaurant with best discount options :stuck_out_tongue:.We just chit - chat until one of us decided to go to home.
